[narfdotpl][]'s dotfiles
========================

Some of my configuration files and scripts used mostly on OS X.

  [narfdotpl]: http://narf.pl/


Installation
============

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/narfdotpl/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    ./install

Installer asks whether to backup files that otherwise would be replaced.
